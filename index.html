                                for example, purifying water and air and providing people with jobs; some 13.2 million
                                people across the world have a job in the forest sector and another 41 million have a
                                job that is related to the sector. Many animals also rely on forests. Eighty percent of
                                the world's land-based species, such as elephants and rhinos, live in forests. Forests
                                also play a critical role in mitigating climate change because they act as a carbon
                                sink—soaking up carbon dioxide that would otherwise be free in the atmosphere and

                        <p>A conclusion of the film is that green energy cannot solve the problem of society's expanding
                            resource depletion without reducing consumption, as all existing forms of energy generation
                            require consumption of finite resources. The film argues that renewable energy sources,
                            including biomass energy, wind power, and solar energy, are not as renewable as they are
                            portrayed to be.</p>

                            <span>Only 90 minutes and you will be stunned at the end of the movie.</span>
                            <span>But don't be paralyzed by it..</span>
                            <span>We all can still figure this out..</span>
                            <span>I know we’re out of time, but let me just close with this analogy:</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>It’s like we're in a lifeboat and there's a leak and it's taking on a lot of water and
                                we're all going to drown, we’re all going to die every one of us in the lifeboat. </p>
                            <p>But I see a Dixie cup a little cup a little paper cup over there in the corner and I’m
                                thinking well I should start bailing the water out with this Dixie cup? </p>
                            <p>But the problem with that is that I know the laws of physics that little cup is not
                                enough to get all this water out - we're going to die..</p>
                            <p>But if the Dixie cup is sitting there what would you do?</p>
                            <p>Would you just sit there and let the boat go down or would you pick it up even though you
                                know you're not going to save yourself?</p>
                            <p>You'd pick it up wouldn't you because here's what happens with us human beings - you
                                start picking it up and you're failing and you're bailing and you look like a crazy
                                man..</p>
                            <p>But then there’s a guy sitting on the other end of the lifeboat and he takes off his ball
                                cap and he starts bailing with the ball cap..</p>
                            <p>Then there's a woman over in the other corner and she's got a bag and out of the bag she
                                pulls out her plastic 3d printer and she prints a scoop and she starts bailing and then
                                the other suddenly joins and now everybody in the lipo..</p>
                            <p>Everyone is coming up with their genius idea which if none of those on their own would
                                ever bale enough water to save everybody - But if everybody came up with these new ideas
                                and started doing them we have a chance to live and survive ..</p>
                            <p>That’s the optimistic end of that story but it requires all of us to do our part..</p>
                            <p>For those who have gotten into bed with Wall Street and corporate America and these
                                billionaires we just have to say thank you for all your good work you did over the
                                years. You've done whatever you've had to do for whatever reasons you had to but we have
                                to save this goddamn planet!!!</p>
